        Everyone faces challenges once in a while. Some challenges are easier than others, but there is always that one challenge that you remember the most. The most significant challenge I’ve ever faced is when I was tasked to host an event when I was in 10th grade. During that time, I joined a club called “Interact Club” and got the position of Activity Leader. My main task is to host activities during class time. I am the kind of person that would put my 100% in when I am doing something that is related to others, and hosting an event is all about keeping others entertained. Most of the time, when I was tasked with hosting an event, some simple activity plan would pop into my head, and I would start preparing right away. However, one time an activity that would take a lot of time to prepare came to my mind, and I started on the project, despite knowing that it would be very time consuming.When I start on something, but have a better idea midway, I would start all over again, since this would mean the participants will feel happier. I spent hours, days, multiple nights working till 3 a.m., to finish the preparation. My parents would try to stop me, but my dedication for the happiness of others had overthrown my laws to obey my parents. I ended up with a custom made trivia with about 50 True or False questions, listed from easy to difficult, separated into three sections, and a couple of extremely tricky tiebreakers. The event turned out really well, and everyone had a lot of fun. All of the effort was worth it, for me. My parents and the club instructor were extremely concerned about my health. They reminded me that there are other leaders in Interact Club, and I am free to ask them for help anytime. My work could have been so much easier if I simply asked for help. My whole concept of achieving a mission had completely changed since then.
